# X (Twitter) List Import Script

A simple Tampermonkey script that lets you quickly add multiple X (Twitter) accounts into one of your Lists. It removes the need to manually add each account one by one.

The motivation for this is simple: to learn from experts in your own X (Twitter) lists without being distracted by the platformâ€™s recommendation algorithm.

## Installation

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) in your browser.
2. Click the link to install the script: https://github.com/aeft/QuickXListAdder/raw/refs/heads/main/add-to-list.user.js
3. Confirm installation in the Tampermonkey prompt.

## Usage

1. Open the target X (Twitter) List page in your browser.

```text
rustlang,guido_van_rossum,JeffDean,golang
```

3. The script will automatically add these accounts to the current List.
